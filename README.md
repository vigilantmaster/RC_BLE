# RC_BLE
Android App that uses bluetooth low energy to control an arduino rc car
It works by sending string characters that the arduino micro controller understands.
Currently I am struggling with getting the micro controller to receiver the stop command when a button is released.
This will take me a while since this is a side project for me.
