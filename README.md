# RC_BLE
Android App that uses bluetooth low energy to control an arduino rc car
It works by sending string characters that the arduino micro controller understands.
I have some more code I need to move to this project.
One file I need to move over is the fix I have for the button presses and it's behavior.
This will take me a while since this is a side project for me and it's a toy.
I do see many benefits to this project like being able to use this code to control other devices with custom procedures.
